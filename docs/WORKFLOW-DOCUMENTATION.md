# Documentation Workflow (3-Step)

> Simplified Interactive workflow for documentation-only changes on main branch

**Use When:** Making changes **only** to `.md` files or code comments

**Key Principles:**
- **Always on main branch** - direct commits, no PRs
- **User approval required** - must approve before commit
- **Skip tests, build, and code review** - not needed for docs
- **Simplified Interactive** - like Interactive workflow but only 3 steps

---

## Overview

The Documentation workflow is a simplified version of the Interactive workflow for documentation-only changes. It commits directly to main with user approval but skips automated testing, build verification, and code review steps since these aren't applicable to markdown files or comments.

**Target:** main branch (direct commits)
**Approvals:** Required
**Steps:** 3 (simplified)

---

## Session Start Procedure

At the start of each new session using this workflow:

1. **Read this workflow file** - Read `docs/WORKFLOW-DOCUMENTATION.md` in full
2. **Reiterate to user** - Summarize the workflow in your own words:
   - Explain this is the Documentation workflow (simplified 3-step)
   - List the key principles (docs-only, main branch, user approval required, skip tests/build/review)
   - Outline the 3 steps (Make Changes → Ask Approval → Commit and Push)
   - Clarify what counts as documentation-only vs. not
3. **Confirm understanding** - Acknowledge understanding of the workflow before proceeding
4. **Proceed with standard session start** - Continue with git status, PLAN.md reading, etc.

This ensures both agent and user have shared understanding of the workflow being followed.

## When to Use

Use Documentation workflow for changes **exclusively** to:
- Markdown files (`.md`)
- Code comments (inline documentation)
- README files
- Documentation in `docs/` folder

**Do NOT use for:**
- Code changes (even with documentation)
- Script changes (even minor)
- Configuration file changes
- Build file changes

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Make Changes

Edit documentation files:
- Update markdown files
- Fix typos and formatting
- Improve clarity and examples
- Add new sections or documentation

**Ensure:**
- Proper markdown formatting
- Internal links work
- Code examples are accurate
- Consistent style with existing docs

### Step 2: Ask Approval

Present changes to user:
- Summarize what was changed
- Explain why changes were made
- List affected files

**Wait for explicit approval** before committing.

### Step 3: Commit and Push

**Ask user approval**, then commit:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Update documentation: [brief description]

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Specific change 3

)"
git push
```

**Done!** No tests, build, or code review needed.

## Important Notes

### What Counts as Documentation-Only

**Documentation-only means:**
- ✅ Markdown file changes
- ✅ Comment changes in code
- ✅ README updates
- ✅ Example updates (if only docs)

**NOT documentation-only:**
- ❌ Code changes with updated comments
- ❌ Script changes (even small)
- ❌ Configuration updates
- ❌ Example code that runs

### When in Doubt

If you're unsure whether changes are documentation-only:
- **Use full Interactive workflow** instead
- Better safe than sorry
- Tests and build won't hurt

### PLAN.md and Phase TODO Updates

Even for docs-only changes:
- **Move completed documentation TODOs** from TODO file to DONE file (e.g., from `docs/PLAN-PHASE-00-TODO.md` to `docs/PLAN-PHASE-00-DONE.md`)
  - Cut the completed TODO item from TODO file
  - Paste it into DONE file with `[x]` checkbox and completion note
  - Example: `- [x] Update bootstrap documentation (completed 2026-01-21)`
- Add new documentation TODOs discovered to appropriate phase TODO file
- Update PLAN.md "Current Status" if phase completion changed

- Updated broken link in docs/architecture.md

**Workflow:**
1. Fix typos in both files
2. Ask user approval

4. Push

**Skipped:** Tests, build, code review

### Example 2: Add New Doc Section

- Added "Troubleshooting" section to docs/bootstrap.md

**Workflow:**
1. Write new troubleshooting section
2. Ask user approval
3. Commit: "Add troubleshooting section to bootstrap guide"
4. Push

**Skipped:** Tests, build, code review

### Example 3: Update Command Examples

**Changes:**
- Updated CLI examples in docs/cli.md

**Workflow:**
1. Update command examples
